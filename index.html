<p>Dear Mom,<br>
You have been a simply wonderful addition to my life. Without you, I would not be here! Your never-ending love and support is truly appreciated, and I am blessed to have a mother as caring, positive, and overall fantastic as you. I am extremely thankful for all the things you do for me (like helping me with the cats, calling me to check on me, and constantly reminding me that a grade does not define me). I love you very much, Mom, and hope you have an incredible Mother's Day!!!!!<br>
Love,<br>
Peter</p>

<p>Dear Grandma,<br>
How do I start? I have so much to be grateful for. Ever since I was a little kid, you have always put me first. You have spent countless hours trying to help me succeed in my academics. I remember when I was in the 8th grade, and we visited you after you had your surgery. You were groggy from the medication, but you still asked me about my history project and how it was coming along! You have spent so many hours helping me prepare for the TACHS and SATs, and now look! I'm at Brown University!!! If it weren't for all of the help you gave me, I would not be where I am today, and for that, I am extremely thankful. Thank you so much for playing a pivotal role in my development into a young man! I love you Granny!!! Have a wonderful Mother's Day!</p>

<p>Love,<br>
Peter</p>

<p>Hi Mom! Peter taught me how to use a laptop and do computer science stuff before he left. I want to thank you so much for saving me by the train station. I was so scared and little and really needed someone to take care of me, and you (being the kind person that you are) picked me up and brought me into a loving home. I love you so very much, and enjoy your Mother's Day!!!!</p>
